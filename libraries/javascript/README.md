# SynTest Framework - JavaScript

> The aim of this tool is make it easier for JavaScript developers to test their code in a more effective and efficient way.

A tool to generate synthetic tests for the JavaScript language

### What is SynTest JavaScript?

SynTest JavaScript is a tool for automatically generating test cases for the JavaScript language. This tool is part of the [SynTest Framework](https://www.syntest.org). This framework contains multiple tools related to the generation of synthetic tests.

### Overview

The common core contains the common interfaces for the code control-flow representation, test case structure, genes, and the implementation for the meta-heuristic search algorithms.

## Installation

#### NPM

The simplest way to use syntest-javascript is by installing the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syntest/javascript).

```bash
$ npm install @syntest/javascript
```

You can install it in your project as shown in the snippit above or you can install the package globally by using the npm options `-g`.

#### From source

The tool can be used by cloning the project, installing its dependencies, and compiling the TypeScript:

- Clone the projects

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:syntest-framework/syntest-javascript.git
```

- Install dependencies

```bash
$ cd syntest-javascript; npm install
```

- Build Syntest-javascript

```bash
$ cd syntest-javascript; npm run build
```

You can create a `.syntest.js` file to change the way the tool behaves.

Finally run the tool

```bash
cd <PATH_TO_SYNTEST_JAVASCRIPT>; npm run standalone
```

The results can be found in the `syntest` folder

## Usage

To start you need to be in the root of the project folder containing the code you want to create test-cases for. Next, you need to install two dev-dependencies in your project, namely [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) and [chai-as-promised](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-as-promised). Both are needed to run the tests.

After installing these dependencies together with the tool, you can run the following example command.

```bash
$ syntest-javascript --target-root-directory="<PATH_TO_YOUR_SOURCE_FOLDER>/src" --total-time=10
```

This will test all javascript code that is contained in the source folder. It will run for 10 seconds.

SynTest-JavaScript is highly configurable and supports a bunch of options and arguments, all of them can be found by providing the `--help` option or `-h` for short. Another way of configuring the tool is by putting a .syntest.js file in the root of your project. The file should have the following structure:

```js
module.exports = {
    "population-size": 10,
    "max-depth": 5,
    ...
}
```
